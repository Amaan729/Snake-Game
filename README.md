# Snake-Game
This project is a fun little take on the classic Snake game, built entirely in Python using the turtle graphics module. It includes everything you'd expect: a moving snake, randomly spawning food, a live scoreboard, and a game-over screen. Simple idea, clean code, and a great way to put Python fundamentals into practice.

🗂️ What's in the Project?
main.py – The heart of the game. Sets up the screen and runs the main game loop.

snake.py – Handles everything about the snake: how it moves, grows, and resets.

food.py – Manages the food mechanics (like making it appear randomly).

scoreboard.py – Keeps track of your score and displays a game-over message.

🧠 What You’ll Learn (or What I Used)
Here are some Python concepts that are used throughout the code:

🧱 Programming Basics
Functions: For organizing code into logical chunks.

If/else statements: To handle game logic like collisions and boundaries.

Loops: For running the main game loop and updating the screen continuously.

🧰 Object-Oriented Programming
Classes: Used for organizing the game into objects like Snake, Food, and Scoreboard.

📚 Built-in & Standard Python Libraries
random: Used to place the food randomly on the screen.

time: Adds a small delay in each frame to control the snake’s speed.

🐢 Third-Party Module
turtle: A simple graphics module that powers the entire game UI. Handles drawing, screen setup, and responding to key presses.

🔁 Other Python Features
Method calls: Like .move(), .reset(), and .update() to keep things moving.

Modular imports: The project is broken into multiple files and uses import to keep things organized and readable.
